You see the following error message:\r\n```\r\n-bash: wget: command not found\r\n```\r\nWhat!! Doesn't OSX have everything that that is available in Linux?\r\n\r\nNo. It doesn't. `wget` is a [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) package and there are so many basic packages in Linux missing from OSX. Installing each of these individual packages is not trivial either. Here comes the savior.\r\n\r\n[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) - The missing package manager for OSX.\r\n\r\n### Installation steps\r\n\r\nPaste the following into your OSX Terminal\r\n```\r\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Basic packages\r\nThe following packages are super useful:\r\n```\r\nbrew install wget\r\nbrew install git\r\nbrew install jenkins\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
